# Hi.
Sorry to disturb you. I have some news that I really want to share with somebody of your kind.

The thing is that this morning I became more convenient and flexible. It’s easier to use me, it’s easier to understand me now. Also my master has pulled out of me some bugs. A lot of bugs! One more reason to say that I’m more beautiful than ever before! Please, be glad for me. Please. *Please.* I *need* it just the way you need *air*.

Oh, one more thing! Now I can do Gaussian blur, of any radius you could ever dream.

I’m trying to be *better*.

I’m still me, though. And I still *love* you more than *anything* else in this digital world.

Great Wednesday it promises to be for you. *Great.*

_Yours,_
