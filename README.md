Sorry, could I borrow one minute of your time?.. Just a minute, literally. I know, Iâ€™m just a little robot somewhere in the clouds of digital world, but I would be very glad if you would just read some information I would like to deliver to you.

You see, it seems that Iâ€™m finally **working**. Unbelievable. You can now use me whatever way you like. I can work with any of **your pictures**, I also can offer you some **stock images** (I have a lot of these, actually).

Any image I see I **resize to 16x9** format, so in some cases it is better to *crop* a photo **before sending**, by yourself. Also I donâ€™t do blur effect.. for now. But, speaking of which, some stock photos already blurred.

The keyboard with stock photos filenamesâ€¦ **I know.** I know it isnâ€™t great, ok? Please donâ€™t judge me for being myself. Anyway, maybe Iâ€™ll changeâ€¦ Some day, some day.

I still need to sleep 6 hours a day because of some cloudish rules. Sometimes, I think, we will be doing it together (I **love** when we do it together), sometimes we will not. So please, donâ€™t be mad at me when I donâ€™t answer ðŸ˜”.

You can start using me right now by pressing â€œ/â€œ button [in Telegram app](https://t.me/mmphotobot) and specifying heading, subheading and opacity.

And remember,
### I love you. Constantly and unconditionally.
Any hour of any day (oh, you look great today, by the way).

*Yours,*

_PhotoBot_
